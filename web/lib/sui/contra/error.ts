/**
 * Error taxonomy for the SDK. Every error the SDK raises itself extends
 * {@link ContraError}, and falls into one of five categories:
 *
 * 1. SDK invariant violations (i.e., a bug in the SDK) — {@link ContraInternalError}.
 * 2. Invalid caller arguments — {@link InvalidArgumentError}.
 * 3. Chain/account-state conditions — explicit error types.
 * 4. Cryptographic/runtime failures — explicit error types.
 * 5. Errors originating from RPC calls (timeouts, transport failures, etc.)
 *    are not wrapped but propagate to the caller untouched.
 *
 * Note: the SDK only *builds* transactions; it does not execute them. A
 * transaction returned by the SDK may still abort on chain with a Move error
 * code from the contract (e.g. a failed proof verification or a state change
 * between build and execution). Those aborts surface through the caller's
 * execution path, not as {@link ContraError}s.
