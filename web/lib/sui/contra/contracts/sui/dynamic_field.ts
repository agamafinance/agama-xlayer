 * In addition to the fields declared in its type definition, a Sui object can have

 * ordinary field names (which are always statically declared identifiers) a
 * dynamic field name can be any value with the `copy`, `drop`, and `store`
 * abilities, e.g. an integer, a boolean, or a string. This gives Sui programmers
 * the flexibility to extend objects on-the-fly, and it also serves as a building
 * block for core collection types
