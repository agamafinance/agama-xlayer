"""Arrow x Agama keeper for X Layer.

One tick does three jobs:

1. Prices. Writes TSLA / NVDA / SPY / AAPL into the StockOracle.
   - RedStone (default for TSLA, NVDA, AAPL): a signed data package is fetched
     from the public gateway, appended to the calldata of `pushRedStone`, and
     the signatures of three of five authorised signers are checked on-chain.
     RedStone stops publishing when the US market closes, so a failed push
     outside trading hours is expected, and the relay below keeps the market
     status up to date. RedStone does not publish SPY.
   - Preferred: Chainlink Data Streams. If DS_API_KEY and DS_API_SECRET are set,
     the keeper fetches the latest signed v11 reports and calls
     `pushReports(bytes[])`. The oracle verifies them on-chain against the X Layer
     VerifierProxy, so the keeper is only a carrier.
   - Fallback: relay of the Chainlink push feeds on Arbitrum (TSLA/USD, NVDA/USD,
     SPY/USD, AAPL/USD) through `pushMany`, bounded on-chain by the deviation cap.
     A value is relayed as current only while it is inside the feed heartbeat.
   Market status follows the xStocks 24/5 schedule (Sunday 20:00 to Friday 20:00
   New York time, NYSE holidays closed) unless Data Streams says otherwise.

2. Protection. For every Agama account: HF < 1.15 with free vault shares ->
   `softDeleverage`; HF < 1 -> `ArrowStabilityPool.liquidate`.

3. Agents. The user deposits a stock and never touches it again:
   - `rebalance` keeps every position at the LTV its owner picked (the stock
     went up: borrow more and put it in the vault; it went down: repay from the
     yield buffer, never from the stock).
   - `compoundIntoStock` turns the vault yield above the debt into MORE STOCK
     and adds it as collateral, through the swap venue the zap allowlists.
   Both are permissionless: the keeper is convenience, not control.

4. Vault CAPO snapshot, once a day (permissionless `snapshot()`).

Requires Foundry's `cast` on PATH. Config via env:
  RPC_URL (default https://xlayerrpc.okx.com), DEPLOYMENT (deployments/196.json),
  KEEPER_KEY (private key with KEEPER_ROLE), ARB_RPC_URL, DS_API_KEY, DS_API_SECRET,
  DS_HOST (default https://api.dataengine.chain.link), INTERVAL (seconds, default 300),
  ONCE=1 to run a single tick, JOBS=redstone,prices,snapshot,protection,agents to pick jobs.
